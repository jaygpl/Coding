# 🐍 Snake Game - Python & Pygame

## 🎮 Game Description

This is a simple **Snake Game** developed using **Python** and the **Pygame** library. The player controls a green snake that moves around the screen, eating red squares (food) to grow longer. The objective is to survive as long as possible by avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake’s own body.

Every time the snake eats food, its length increases and the score goes up. The game ends when the snake runs into the walls or itself.
